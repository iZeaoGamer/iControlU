## What is it?
iControlU enables server admins to control other players! With iCU, you can easily control a target's movements, chats, inventory, and more. Everyone loves to troll, and now you can troll at the next level!

Using iCU is easy: first pick a target - the player who unfortunately gets to be picked on. Second: use the command /icu control (that player's name). Finally, begin moving. You literally control your target like a puppet! Feel free to impersonate him in chat, grief his friend's house, mess with his inventory, and ultimately troll him! When you're finished, you can simply exit Control Mode. To do that, use the command /icu stop. You are given invisibility for 10 seconds, so you can run from the scene and never be caught! Or, you can always repeat the process again if you're up to it!

## Commands
* **/icu control (player)** - enter Control Mode. (player) is now your puppet!
* **/icu stop** - exit Control Mode and return your target to free will.

## Permissions
* **icu.use** --  Use the /icu command.
* **icu.exempt** -- players with this node cannot be controlled
